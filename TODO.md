#Left Off
* 3 Favorite search entries
    * Requires... Star icon. New view. Local storage.

* Restructure LESS so Full Large layout rules aren't mixed with global rules

#Future Fun
* 4 Migrate to MongoDB
* 3 Paging (dependent on MongoDB)
* 3 DB generate script incorrect for HSK
    * Some characters have multiple entries, where not all of the entries are HSK
        * Âè∑ as an example has a HSK 1 entry and a HSK nothing entry
        * My HSK list is character only, so I need to add to that for comparison somehow
* 3 Always auto-focus on input
    * Don't defocus on search? Or did I specifically code to defocus already?
    * Set shortcut to focus?
* 2 Responsive design gets funky at 900px and below
* 2 Highlight search hits
* 2 Allow whitelisted 1 letter words
    * Only English needs to be whitelisted for 1 letter
* 1 Allow idiom searches because edit distance doesn't work there
* 1 HSK css animation stalls with large result sets
    * It appears that the animation waits for the response to come back, by then it's too late and it just jumps instead
* 1 About page
    * Credits
    * Contact
    * Total searches count
