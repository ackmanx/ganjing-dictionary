#Left Off
* 3 Recent Searches dropdown is ugly since I renamed it
    * Safari and FF suck with it in general

#Future Fun
* ? Move build files to /dist and don't expose /public
* 4 Migrate to MongoDB
   * MongoDB add on for Heroku
        * Any configuration settings for that
   *  Add drivers to package.json
   *  Require in server bootstrap and configure
   *  Full text search for queries?
   *  Dictionary updates
        * Blow away and start over?
* 3 Paging (dependent on MongoDB)
* 3 More frequently used characters/words should have higher relevence
* 1 Allow idiom searches because edit distance doesn't work there
