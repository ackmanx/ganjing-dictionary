#Left Off
* Allow whitelisted 1 letter words
* DB generate script incorrect for HSK
    * Some characters have multiple entries, where not all of the entries are HSK
        * Âè∑ as an example has a HSK 1 entry and a HSK nothing entry
* Style results into columns
    * Icon for exact match results

#Future Fun
* Pinyin tones
* Specify search language
* Help text on initial page load
* Responsive design gets funky at 900px and below
* Mobile should defocus search input on search so the keyboard goes away
* HSK css animation stalls with large result sets
    * It appears that the animation waits for the response to come back, by then it's too late and it just jumps instead
* About page
    * Credits
